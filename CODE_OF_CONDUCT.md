# Udacity Honor Code and Community Code of Conduct

Last updated February 07, 2018

## Honor Code

By enrolling in a Udacity program or Online Course, or otherwise accessing the Udacity platform or interacting with any of the Udacity Services, you agree to abide by the following Udacity Honor Code, which we created to ensure the best learning experience for you and for all other Udacity Students (as defined in our Terms of Use). Students found to be acting in violation of the terms set forth may be asked to leave their program without a refund. By using Udacity, you also agree to our Terms of Use, including the User Conduct Policy, and, if you participate in any of our communities, the Community Code of Conduct. Please conduct yourself responsibly and employ common-sense when participating in any Udacity community or program. You further understand and agree that all decisions regarding participation, graduation, and awarding of verified certificates will be made by Udacity in its sole discretion.

You agree that you:

- will not harass other Students, Attendees, Visitors, or Udacity Employees;

- will not cheat on any assignment, projects, or assessments, as applicable, for the Online Courses. For example, giving or receiving unpermitted aid on, or copying or sharing of, another User’s (as defined in the Terms of Use) projects or other class work (or any portion thereof);

- will not plagiarize (a form of cheating) the work of others. For example, using another person’s original work (e.g., code, language, formulas, etc.) in your assignments, projects, or assessments. For more information on plagiarism, see our full definition and examples here.

- will not post online any secured testing materials, as applicable;

- will comply with the requirements of the specific applicable code of conduct, if any, relating directly to a Nanodegree program in which such you are enrolled; and

- will notify the instructors immediately if you become aware of any other User cheating or breaching this Honor Code or the Terms of Use.

If you are registered or enrolled as a Student in, or are otherwise attending, an Online Course through an Educational Partner or other institution with its own policy regarding student and/or employee conduct or an "honor code," those terms may also apply to you.

Failure to adhere to this Honor Code impairs the integrity of our learning environment and harms the value of our Nanodegree programs for our Students. If we determine that you have violated this Honor Code, we reserve the right to take any action we deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, rejecting your submissions or removing you from our programs with no refund.
